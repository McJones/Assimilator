Assimilator
===========

My entrance for the first [Go South Awards](http://gosouthawards.com)

The idea is a rather silly one, Lizard People and Illuminati are hiding out in the heritage builds strewn over Tasmania, and you are there to stop them.

The concept behind this is that I feel the most underrated aspect of Tasmania is all the marvellous heritage buildings it has and wanted force a little spotlight on them.

You can use anything in here for anything you want but the rather fabulous lizard in a suit, drawn for me by [Rex Smeal](https://twitter.com/rexsmeal), cannot be used unless you are building a copy of Assimilator.

If you want to use the database I wrote to go with this app, buzz me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/the_mcjones), I just don't want people burning through my Parse limits...
